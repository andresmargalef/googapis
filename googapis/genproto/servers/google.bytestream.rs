    /// #### Introduction
    ///
    /// The Byte Stream API enables a client to read and write a stream of bytes to
    /// and from a resource. Resources have names, and these names are supplied in
    /// the API calls below to identify the resource that is being read from or
    /// written to.
    ///
    /// All implementations of the Byte Stream API export the interface defined here:
    ///
    /// * `Read()`: Reads the contents of a resource.
    ///
    /// * `Write()`: Writes the contents of a resource. The client can call `Write()`
    ///   multiple times with the same resource and can check the status of the write
    ///   by calling `QueryWriteStatus()`.
    ///
    /// #### Service parameters and metadata
    ///
    /// The ByteStream API provides no direct way to access/modify any metadata
    /// associated with the resource.
    ///
    /// #### Errors
    ///
    /// The errors returned by the service are in the Google canonical error space.
